# Introduction

My dataset is based on global terrorism data from 1970-2020. This data set includes 135 different variables. Most of which are supporting variables to others. The main variables that I used in my project were iyear, imonth, iday which I later turned into a single variable date. counrty, country_txt(name of country), region, region_txt(name of region), provstate(exp: Missouri), city, latitude, longitude, gname(group name), nkill(number killed), weaptype1, and  weaptype1_txt(weapon type in text). Most of the other variables I either found had little data or did not find much importance to the data.

My questions for the data set

#1 What terrorist groups have killed the most people?

#2 Has terrorism increased or decreased over the past 50 years as well as what incidents have caused the most devastation?

#3 Where have terrorists targeted the most in the United States?

#4 What weapons are the deadliest?

# Analysis/Visualizations

## #1 What terrorist groups have killed the most people?

The deadliest groups are the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant(ISIL) with 38,923. ISIL is a large terrorist group that originated in Iraq. Next is the Taliban who originated from Afghanistan with a still large death toll of 29,410. Third Boko Haram mostly originates from Nigeria. Fourth Shining Path a communist group from Peru and if combined fifth would be Al-Qaida the group behind 9/11.


## #2 Has terrorism increased or decreased over the past 50 years as well as what incidents have caused the most devastation?

Looking at the past 50 years it is clear that terrorism has not decreased instead it seems that within the past 20 years, in general, terrorism has increased in frequency as well as large-scale events are more devastating.

I condensed the data into countries that have had large terrorist events that cause dramatic death tolls and damage. The countries that I choose were Iran, Iraq, Rwanda, Somalia, and the United State. All five of these countries have had serious issues or events that have created a large change in the world's terrorism data. I have done my best to connect my data to real-world events. 
The events that I found connected to the large spikes in deaths
Cinema fire Iraq 1978
Rewanda genocide 1994
9/11 United States 2001
Iraq war many different events in a short time 2014/2015
Al-Shabaab in Somalia 2019


## #3 Where have terrorists targeted the most in the United States?


![United States map-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95449976/206514095-8e026d25-e61d-4008-bb4b-38e1bcbff0c5.png)


There was a total of 253 different cases that occurred in the United state. Of those 253 over 50% were located in eastern states. As well we can see that of the western events most of which were located in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The largest events were 9/11 and the OKC bombing which had the most casualties. Overall this made me realize how little the United States is affected by terrorism as compared to other countries.


## #4 What weapons are the deadliest?


![Weapon-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95449976/206514150-8b6818a2-5d80-4d1f-a725-1ceb97e529ab.png)


This is a close race between firearms and explosives. Firearms are no doubt the most common weapon but, it is surprising, that organizations such as these have so much access to explosives and other forms of weapons such as chemicals, sabotage equipment, biological weapons, and radiological weapons. It is also interested to see that in over 180,000 observations one person was so unlucky enough to be killed by a fake weapon.


# Conclusion

Terrorism is not dissipating and the largest groups of terrorists are still causing a lot of devastation and death.  ISIL and Taliban are the most well-known terrorist organizations and for good reason. Combined they total nearly 70,000 deaths and continue to be the deadliest terrorist organization to date. While looking at the effect of terrorism on the united state the eastern states have received most of the devastation but the large cities of California also get attacked quite often. While the United States has had terrible tragedies such as 9/11 we are far from being the most affected country when it comes to terrorism. Finally, firearms and explosives are the most common type of weapons that terrorists use. While they have quite a diverse set of weapons at their disposal.
