# Introduction

My dataset is based on global terrorism data from 1970-2020. This data set includes 135 different variables. Most of which are supporting variables to others. The main variables that I used in my project were iyear, imonth, iday which I later turned into a single variable date. counrty, country_txt(name of country), region, region_txt(name of region), provstate(exp: Missouri), city, latitude, longitude, gname(group name), nkill(number killed), weaptype1, and  weaptype1_txt(weapon type in text). Most of the other variables I either found had little data or did not find much importance to the data.

My questions for the data set

#1 What terrorist groups have killed the most people?
#2 Has terrorism increased or decreased over the past 50 years as well as what incidents have caused the most devastation?
#3 Where have terrorists targeted the most in the United States?
#4 What weapons are the deadliest?
